This game is developed in Python using pygame library. Aim of this game is to compare the
efficiency of playing the game by human and the computer. This game has 2 modes.

User mode: User can play the game. User should select the treasures and then based on the
selection score will be calculated. Time can be set by the user.

key bot starts moving and collects treasures in their descending order of scores in user specified
time interval. Bot uses Dijkstra's algorithm to collect the treasures.
